# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Portfolio | Juan Cortes (ExoJuca4-x)

## ✨ Professional Statement

My name is Juan Cortes, and my interest in cybersecurity is driven by the ability to protect digital assets by thinking like the adversary. I possess a technical foundation in Python programming for automation, SQL usage, and system administration for both Linux and Windows, with a strong commitment to ethics and confidentiality. I apply my core values of protecting people and organizations. I am seeking an entry-level opportunity, such as a Cybersecurity Analyst or a Security-Focused Help Desk Technician, to apply my dual mindset (Red/Blue Team) and logical skills toward proactive defense.
